Break down of each task:

1. **Create .Net 8 web application**: This task involves developing a web application using the .NET framework version 8. The .NET framework provides a platform for 
                                      building various types of applications, including web applications. You would use tools and libraries provided by .NET to create 
                                      the application, such as ASP.NET Core for web development.

2. **Create DTOs & Models based on the Figma designs**: DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and Models are classes that represent the data used in the application. Figma designs 
                                      are visual representations of how the application's user interface should look. So, this task involves creating classes in your .NET 
                                      application that match the data structures and entities depicted in the Figma designs. These classes will be used to transfer data between 
                                      different parts of the application and to interact with the database.

3. **Implement CRUD APIs**: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations for managing data in a database. In this task, you would create 
                                      APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the client-side of the application to perform these CRUD operations on the data 
                                      stored in the database. These APIs typically handle HTTP requests from the client, perform the necessary operations on the database,  
                                      and return the appropriate responses.

4. **Data stored in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**: Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Microsoft Azure. NoSQL databases are non-relational 
                                      databases that are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. In this task, you would configure 
                                      your .NET application to use Azure Cosmos DB as its database backend, allowing you to store and retrieve data in a NoSQL format.

5. **Local Cosmos DB Emulator**: The Local Cosmos DB Emulator is a tool provided by Microsoft that allows you to run a local instance of Cosmos DB on your development machine. 
                                     This allows you to develop and test your application without needing to connect to a live Azure Cosmos DB instance. In this task, 
                                     you would use the Local Cosmos DB Emulator to simulate the Cosmos DB environment locally during development and testing.

6. **Utilize dependency injection**: Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in software development to improve code modularity and maintainability by reducing 
                                     the coupling between components. In .NET applications, dependency injection is typically implemented using built-in features 
                                     provided by the framework, such as the ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection container. In this task, you would organize your application's 
                                     components and services in a way that allows them to be easily injected into other components when needed, making your code more flexible 
                                     and easier to test.

7. **Unit test (xUnit) with .NET**: Involves writing unit tests using the xUnit framework to ensure the correctness and robustness of your .NET web application's components 
                                    and functionalities.
